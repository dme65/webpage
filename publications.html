                <p>
                  This paper describes a new efficient algorithm for the rapid
                  computation of exact shortest distances between a point cloud
                  and another object (e.g. triangulated, point-based, etc.) in
                  three dimensions. It extends the work presented in Eriksson
                  and Shellshear (2014) where only approximate distances were
                  computed on a simplification of a massive point cloud. Here,
                  the fast computation of the exact shortest distance is
                  achieved by pruning large subsets of the point cloud known
                  not to be closest to the other object. The approach works for
                  massive point clouds even with a small amount of RAM and is
                  able to provide real time performance. Given a standard PC
                  with only 8GB of RAM, this resulted in real-time shortest
                  distance computations of 15 frames per second for a point
                  cloud having 1 billion points in three dimensions.

                <p>
                  Tropospheric delay modeling error continues to be one of the
                  largest sources of error in VLBI (very long baseline
                  interferometry) analysis. For standard operational solutions,
                  we use the VMF1 elevation-dependent mapping functions derived
                  from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts data.
                  These mapping functions assume that tropospheric delay at a
                  site is azimuthally symmetric. As this assumption is not
                  true, we have instead determined the ray trace delay along
                  the signal path through the troposphere for each VLBI quasar
                  observation. We determined the troposphere refractivity
                  fields from the pressure, temperature, specific humidity, and
                  geopotential height fields of the NASA Goddard Space Flight
                  Center Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 numerical
                  weather model. When applied in VLBI analysis, baseline length
                  repeatabilities were improved compared with using the VMF1
                  mapping function model for 72% of the baselines and site
                  vertical repeatabilities were better for 11 of 13 sites
                  during the 2 week CONT11 observing period in September 2011.
                  When applied to a larger data set (2011–2013), we see a
                  similar improvement in baseline length and also in site
                  position repeatabilities for about two thirds of the stations
                  in each of the site topocentric components.

                  Variations in continental water storage lead to loading
                  deformation of the crust with typical peak-to-peak variations
                  at very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) sites of 3–15 mm
                  in the vertical component and 1–2 mm in the horizontal
                  component. The hydrology signal at VLBI sites has annual and
                  semi-annual components and clear interannual variations. We
                  have calculated the hydrology loading series using mass
                  loading distributions derived from the global land data
                  assimilation system (GLDAS) hydrology model and alternatively
                  from a global grid of equal-area gravity recovery and climate
                  experiment (GRACE) mascons. In the analysis of the two weekly
                  VLBI 24-h R1 and R4 network sessions from 2003 to 2010 the
                  baseline length repeatabilities are reduced in 79 % (80 %) of
                  baselines when GLDAS (GRACE) loading corrections are applied.
                  Site vertical coordinate repeatabilities are reduced in about
                  80 % of the sites when either GLDAS or GRACE loading is used.
                  In the horizontal components, reduction occurs in 70–80 % of
                  the sites. Estimates of the annual site vertical amplitudes
                  were reduced for 16 out of 18 sites if either loading series
                  was applied. We estimated loading admittance factors for each
                  site and found that the average admittances were 1.01 ±
                  0.05 for GRACE and 1.39 ± 0.07 for GLDAS. The standard
                  deviations of the GRACE admittances and GLDAS admittances
                  were 0.31 and 0.68, respectively. For sites that have been
                  observed in a set of sufficiently temporally dense daily
                  sessions, the average correlation between VLBI vertical
                  monthly averaged series and GLDAS or GRACE loading series was
                  0.47 and 0.43, respectively.

                  In this paper, algorithms have been developed that are
                  capable of efficiently pre-processing massive point clouds
                  for the rapid computation of the shortest distance between a
                  point cloud and other objects (e.g. triangulated,
                  point-based, etc.). This is achieved by exploiting fast
                  distance computations between specially structured subsets of
                  a simplified point cloud and the other object. This approach
                  works for massive point clouds even with a small amount of
                  RAM and was able to speed up the computations, on average, by
                  almost two orders of magnitude. Given only 8 GB of RAM, this
                  resulted in shortest distance computations of 30 frames per
                  second for a point cloud originally having 1 billion points.
                  The findings and implementations will have a direct impact
                  for the many companies that want to perform path-planning
                  applications through massive point clouds since the
                  algorithms are able to produce real-time distance
                  computations on a standard PC.
